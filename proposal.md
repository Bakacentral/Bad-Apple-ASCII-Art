# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Bad Apple ASCII Art  

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Recreate the music video of the iconic song Bad Apple which consists of only black and white colors through the use of ASCII Art done by code.


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

This project will be able to take the provided frames of the entirety of bad apple given, 6,569 frames, and be able to recreate each frame with ASCII art to mimic the black and white animations which are shown in the music video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8). This project will also attempt to play the music and sync up the ASCII art with the correspdonding moment of the song(this might be impossible depending on how long it takes for the art to print)


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be able to recreate each frame, having the black frames be replaced with @, and the white frames left blank. 


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be able to recreate each frame with better ASCII art, in other words being able to incorparate other characters like "*","-","_" ect.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be able to recreate all of that while have the song play at the same time, and having each frame of the ASCII art match up with the art in the music video.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I would need to look into how to create ASCII art using python, or if there are any alternative programs that can be used which would suit the project better. I would then need to look into how ASCII art is created in the first place. I also need to learn how to actually implement the ASCII art and how to analyze each pixel within the song to detect whether it is a black frame, since the song is only in black and white I only need to figure out whether or not the frame is black as all I need to do is skip the white pixels (if black then print what I want else don't print). Lastly I need to see if it is possible to sinc up the art with the music video.
