# Bad-Apple-ASCII-Art
Background
Bad Apple is a song composed by ZUN, creator of the Touhou Series. Touhou Series is a game series starting since 1997 which features 19 main-line games and 13 spin offs where ZUN did all of the music composition, graphic art, writing, and coding all on his own. Bad Apple is a song which was originally featured in Touhou 4, lotus land story(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7IoHiD0Kuo). Zun allows for free use of all of his Touhou Franchise as long as it follows some rules and conditions, this has allowed for remixing of his music, and free use of the characters he has designed in the Touhou Series. This gave birth to the Touhou Project, which involved fans using the base foundation of music and characters in the Touhou Series to create their own games, animations, remixs, manga, and songs. Thanks to the freedom given by ZUN, Bad Apple was able to be remixed by Alstroemeria Records and provided lyrics sung by Nomico in 2007 and later a follow up animation by NICONICODOUGA user "Anira" to form what Bad Apple is known as today.


Goal 

Recreate the music video of the iconic song Bad Apple which consists of only black and white colors through the use of ASCII Art done by code.

This project will be able to take the provided frames of the entirety of bad apple given, 6,569 frames, and be able to recreate each frame with ASCII art to mimic the black and white animations which are shown in the music video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtutLA63Cp8). This project will also attempt to play the music and sync up the ASCII art with the correspdonding moment of the song(this might be impossible depending on how long it takes for the art to print)

A good outcome would be able to recreate each frame, having the black frames be replaced with @, and the white frames left blank. 

A better outcome would be able to recreate each frame with better ASCII art, in other words being able to incorparate other characters like "*","-","_" ect.

The best outcome would be able to recreate all of that while have the song play at the same time, and having each frame of the ASCII art match up with the art in the music video.

Research plan

I would need to look into how to create ASCII art using python, or if there are any alternative programs that can be used which would suit the project better. I would then need to look into how ASCII art is created in the first place. I also need to learn how to actually implement the ASCII art and how to analyze each pixel within the song to detect whether it is a black frame, since the song is only in black and white I only need to figure out whether or not the frame is black as all I need to do is skip the white pixels (if black then print what I want else don't print). Lastly I need to see if it is possible to sinc up the art with the music video.
