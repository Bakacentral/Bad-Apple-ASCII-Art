# Bad-Apple-ASCII-Art
Background  
  Bad Apple is a song composed by ZUN, creator of the Touhou Series. Touhou Series is a game series starting since 1997 which features 19 main-line games and 13 spin offs where ZUN did all of the music composition, graphic art, writing, and coding all on his own. Bad Apple is a song which was originally featured in Touhou 4, lotus land story(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7IoHiD0Kuo). Zun allows for free use of all of his Touhou Franchise as long as it follows some rules and conditions, this has allowed for remixing of his music, and free use of the characters he has designed in the Touhou Series. This gave birth to the Touhou Project, which involved fans using the base foundation of music and characters in the Touhou Series to create their own games, animations, remixs, manga, and songs. Notable songs in the Touhou Series include but are not limited to U.N owen was her, necrofantasia, Night of Nights, We are Japanese goblins, tiny little adiantum, and Marisa Stole the Precious Thing. Thanks to the freedom given by ZUN, Bad Apple was able to be remixed by Alstroemeria Records and provided lyrics sung by Nomico in 2007 and later a follow up animation by NICONICODOUGA user "Anira" to form what Bad Apple is known as today.

This Project is heavily inspired by youtuber Junferno(https://www.youtube.com/@Junferno/videos : https://github.com/kevinjycui)
