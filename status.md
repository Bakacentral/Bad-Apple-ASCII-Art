Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have imported all frames necessary for the project and finished my research on how to approach ASCII art

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have yet to outline what my project code looks like.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

The frames also include grey blobs, so its not just black and white imagery which I need to convert.
